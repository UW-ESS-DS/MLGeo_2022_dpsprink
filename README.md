# Research Interests:
Generally I am interested in advancing seismic methods for applications to a variety of subsurface science problems.
For the past 4 years I have worked at PNNL in the Geophysics and Geomechanics capapbility. Most of my work centers around 
applying geophysics, mostly seismology to challenges associated with imaging and monitoring Enhanced Geothermal Systems,
subsurface contamination, and underground explosions. I am also interested in both natural and induced seismicity. I am keen 
to learn and improve upon existing algorithms that use passive interferometry for subsurface imaging and monitoring. 
Some skills I have and am honing:
 
- Data Science / Machine Learning
- Seismic Inversion
- Coda Wave Interferometry / Ambient Noise
- Distributed Acoustic Sensing
